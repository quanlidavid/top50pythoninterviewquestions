# 1. How will you improve the performance of a program in Python?

"""
There are many ways to improve the performance of a Python program. Some of these are as follows:
1. Data Structure: We have to select the right data structure for our purpose in a Python program.
2. Standard Library: Wherever possible, we should use methods from standard library.
    Methods implemented in standard library have much better performance than user implementation.
3. Abstraction: At times, a lot of abstraction and indirection can cause slow performance of a program.
    We should remove the redundant abstraction in code.
4. Algorithm: Use of right algorithm can make a big difference in a program.
    We have to find and select the suitable algorithm to solve our problem with high performance.
