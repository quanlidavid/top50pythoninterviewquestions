# 3. How will you specify source code encoding in a Python source file?

"""
By default, every source code file in Python is in UTF-8 encoding.
But we can also specify our own encoding for source files.
This can be done by adding following line after #! line in the source file.

# -*-coding: encoding-*-

In the above line we can replace encoding with the encoding that we want to use.
