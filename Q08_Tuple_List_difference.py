# 8. What is the difference between a Tuple and List in Python?
'''
In Python, Tuple and List are built-in data structures.
Some of the differences between Tuple and List are as follows:
    1. Syntax: A Tuple is enclosed in parentheses:
        E.g. myTuple = (10, 20, "apple");
        A List is enclosed in brackets:
        E.g. myList = [10, 20, 30];
    2. Mutable: Tuple is an immutable data structure. Whereas, a List is a
        mutable data structure.
    3. Size: A Tuple takes much lesser space than a List in Python.
    4. Performance: Tuple is faster than a List in Python. So it gives us
        good performance.
    5. Use case: Since Tuple is immutable, we can use it in cases like
        Dictionary creation. Whereas, a List is preferred in the use case
        where data can alter.
